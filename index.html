<h4>
Hello! Thank you for visiting my summer 2025 travel journal! This site captures some of my favorite moments from my travels across the U.S. this Summer of 2025
</h4>
<P>
This summer I was fortunate to be able to travel to over 3 states. After quitting my job and preparing to start grad school I was determined to fill the summer with as much adventure as I could. On this site you'll be able to find information about the places I went including: A trip itenerary, a list of highlights with pictures, who I travelled with, and lastly some tips for travelling if you find yourself in the same place I did. Thank you again for visiting my site and I hope it can bring you some of the joy I felt this summer!
</P>
