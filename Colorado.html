<h2>Colorado - The Centenial State</h2>
<p class=welcometext>My trip to Colorado had been planned around 6 months in advanced along with some of my best friends from college to visit one of them who now resised on Boulder. 
    I've alwasy wanted to see the visit but never really had a reason too until my friend Molly moved
    It was an exciting trip that not only brought back fond memories but allowed me to experience the beauty of the mountains in the West

Who I Travelled With 
        </h3>
    <p class="WhoITW">
My college friends: Andrea, Sophia, Kayla all travelled together to meet our friend Molly who lived in Boulder.
<h3>Top 3 Tips</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Hydrate</b> - Colorado has an elevation of almost a mile, so it's important to drink a lot of water as you can get dehydrated quickly. You can also prevent elevation sickness this way</li>
        <li><b>Bring Hiking Shoes</b> - Colorado is known for its natural beaty so make sure you are dressed accordingly to be able to see it. Make sure to bring a pair of hiking boots ideally or sneakers</li>
        <li><b>Rent a Car</b> - While Denver and Boulder have great public transportation, if you are looking to travel around national parks and get to other places of the state like Golden, travel by car is best. Look for rentals or find a friend that has a car!</li>
      </ol>
