<h2>California - The Golden State</h2>
<p class=welcometext>California was the second trip got to take this summer. 
    Growing up on the East Coast I had always dreamed about going to the West Coast to visit California and see what was on the other side. 
    When my Dad offered me to join him on a business trip there I jumped at the opportunity and the business trip turned into an exploration of the Golden State!

<h3>
Who I Travelled With 
        </h3>
    <p class="WhoITW">
I was able to join my Dad on this trip. Originally just a business trip for a conference in San Diego, it quicly morphed into a road trip and adventure around California. On the way were were also able to meet up with family members in San Jose     </p>
    
<h3>Top 3 Tips</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Utilize Public Transit</b> - Both SFO and San Diego have excellent public transit systems and if you plan on flying SFO BART will take you right from the airport to downtown</li>
        <li><b>Bring Layers</b> - While San Diego can be relatively warm, SFO can be rather unpredictable with the temperature so it's best to bring an extra layer to take on and off as needed </li>
        <li><b>Make Reservations</b> - While many attractions in SFO can be free or relatively affordable many require reservations like spots at national parks or even time slots at Coit Tower</li>
      </ol>
